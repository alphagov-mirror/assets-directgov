	<h2>A white label service <acronym title="White label service">(WLS)</acronym> should.</h2>
	<ul class="bullet">
		<li>Be an application or transaction.</li>
		<li>Improve current Directgov offering for the customer.</li>
		<li>Add value to the customer and only be considered if technical integration is not possible because it is too difficult or expensive.</li>

		<li>Be consistent with Directgov styleguide.</li>
		<li>Be actively managed by the franchise or service provider.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="subcontent">
	<h2>A white label service should not</h2>
	<ul class="bullet">
		<li>Be static content (all content should go into the Directgov <acronym title="Content management system">CMS</acronym>).</li>

		<li>Be outside of the management processes of Directgov or wider franchise governance process.</li>
		<li>Be a home of last resort for 'stray' government web sites.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="subcontent">
	<h2>Welsh translation</h2>
	<p>Material published on Directgov should be provided in Welsh unless it is specifically not for people in Wales.</p>
	<p>Transaction/tool providers should look to provide transactions in Welsh for appearance at the same time as those in English. For transactions/tools nearing completion, if there is no Welsh version, planning details need to be supplied to Directgov to show when the Welsh version will be added. Should a transaction/tool have a case for not being in Welsh, that case should be put forward to Directgov in first instance. It's unlikely there will be such a case as departments should be building transactions/tools in Welsh in any case as part of their own commitments under their departmental Welsh language schemes.</p>

</div>
<div class="subcontent">
	<h2>Definitions</h2>
	<h3>White Label Product or Service (WLS)?</h3>
	<p>A white label product or service is a product or service produced by a department or agency that is branded as Directgov to fit seamlessly into the Directgov customer journey. A white labelled service (WLS) does not sit on the core Directgov infrastructure due to tactical and technical reasons.</p>
	<h3>Tool</h3>
	<p>Simple interactive transactions such as schools look up; where the citizen enters information (possibly personal, but anonymous) and has relevant tailored information returned.</p>

	<h3>Transaction</h3>
	<p>Complex interactive transactions like applications/submissions, service bookings and payment. These are defined as those citizen facing interactions that require two way interactions between the citizen and government e.g. application, submission, case tracking.</p>
</div>
<div class="subcontent">
	<h2>Criteria for a WLS</h2>
	<p>To ensure that Directgov's integrity is maintained, stringent criteria will be applied to any WLS before it goes live. It should be made clear at the outset that unless a service meets (or met) the specified standards prior to launch then the site will not be promoted or linked to from Directgov.</p>
	<p>The following represent a series of requirements for integrating a white labelled site into Directgov.</p>

	<h3>Adherence to toolkit and standards</h3>
	<p>The quality criteria are defined by adherence to:</p>
	<ul class="bullet">
		<li>Transaction styleguide</li>
		<li>Brand styleguide</li>
		<li>Editorial styleguide</li>

		<li>Completion of WLS checklist</li>
		<li>Technical guidelines</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Budget</h3>
	<p>This will be covered in the initial requirements gathering stage to understand what costs there maybe for Central Team, Franchises and potentially any third parties (NDPBs etc) and how these are apportioned. Transactions manager and Franchise developer manager will ensure the correct expending and budget allocation.</p>
	<h3>Service Level Agreements (SLA)/Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs)</h3>

	<p>In some cases a Service Level Agreement will need to be signed between the parties involved, to ensure commitment and continuity on the delivering and running of the WLS between the service provider and Directgov.</p>
	<p>Most WLS will require a formal agreement between Directgov and the service provider, however, there are occasions whereby an WLS will fall within existing agreements and won't require a separate SLA. This is to be agreed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p>Where SLAs or OLAs are deemed necessary, information detailing technology, business and customer support processes should be provided.</p>
	<h3><acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>s</h3>
	<p>The policy for WLS is for the site to have a sub domain that clearly indicates the service is associated with Directgov.</p>
	<p><strong>e.g. http://whitelabelsite.direct.gov.uk</strong></p>

	<p>Users will recognise that they are on the Directgov site, even if the WLS is not on the central infrastructure.</p>
	<p>The sub domain will never be marketed; it is simply a way of confirming to those users who notice the URL has changed due to leaving the main Directgov web site.</p>
	<p>Specific marketing URLs will always direct users to a Directgov article page.</p>
	<h3>Search Engine Optimisation</h3>
	<p>All WLS should be hidden from external search engines so that, as with the URLs, the user is always directed first to the main Directgov site. Specifying the customer journey, including SEO, will be done in the initial requirements gathering stage. The Directgov Marketing Team will co-ordinate - as with any other marketing activity - with the relevant franchise to ensure the service is appropriately promoted using SEO.</p>
	<h3>Site Search</h3>

	<p>Any WLS needs to ensure that the preceding Directgov page (e.g. the one hosted on the central infrastructure) is fully optimised via the Central Search Team. Directgov advises to remove metadata for transactional pages for avoiding external crawlers being able to find pages from within the transaction.</p>
	<h3>Transaction 'Tunnel'</h3>
	<p>Once the Citizen has started the transactions, then all links that could take the citizen out of the transaction before completion should be removed.</p>
	<h3>Step tracker for Complex Transactions</h3>
	<p>For the more complex transactions, the 'workflow' steps involved, and the progress being made, should be made clear to the citizen.</p>
	<h3>Return Path to Directgov</h3>

	<p>A return path to main Directgov site should be provided at the end of the service. The Directgov logo in the masthead can also be clickable to the homepage.</p>
	<h3>Service Provider Accreditation</h3>
	<p>A co-branding module should be displayed at the beginning of a transaction - refer to the co-branding guidelines.</p>
	<h3>User Acceptance Testing (<acronym title="User acceptance testing">UAT</acronym>)</h3>
	<p>WLS sites must go through Directgov Quality Assurance.</p>

	<p>Close involvement with the Test Team is required throughout the Development process to ensure that any potential issues can be identified and resolved before release.</p>
	<p>Directgov will only be able to provide advice on User Acceptance Testing and Editorial QA.</p>
	<h3>Management Information</h3>
	<p>An agreement on the provision of management information to and from the Directgov MIS Manager, included in the SLA, needs to be concluded before launch.</p>
	<p>This will ensure that both parties can track usage on an ongoing basis. The information gathered can be included in the regular traffic reports produced for Directgov.</p>
	<p>Where a WLS is a more sophisticated transaction, then more specific customer journey tracking information may be required to ensure that Directgov and the service provider can gain detailed understanding of the full customer journey.</p>

	<p>The implementation of Speedtrap tags are required in order that Directgov can gain metrics.</p>
	<h3>Contact Strategy</h3>
	<p>Agreement needs to be reached as to who to direct complaints/contacts from the public that come into the Directgov Helpdesk and likewise if any complaints/contacts go direct to the WLS about Directgov.</p>
	<p>The Contact Strategy developed for the Motoring Franchise is the current, accepted Directgov model. This is where any e-mails that come to the Directgov Helpdesk about a specific WLS service are handed off to the service provider, via a message to the customer informing them that XXX is responsible for the service, and that their mail has been forwarded. It is then incumbent onto the service provider to respond to the query.</p>
	<p>Note that should any WLS not respond promptly to feedback via Directgov, then this could ultimately result in it being removed from the site as it is deemed that this will damage the Directgov brand. Decision to be made by the Directgov Director of Proposition and Strategy.</p>
